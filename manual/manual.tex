\maketitle

\section*{Single Player}

Once the application has started, press the \verb+vsAI+ button. You should be taken to an AI player selection. The number in the centre of the screen is the number of AI opponents present in the game. The right arrow increases and the left arrow decreases the number of enemies. The \verb+Start+ button starts the game.

\section*{Multiplayer}

Start the dedicated server by giving the port as command-line argument. If none is given, the default ports used are 55555(6). Once the server is running, select \verb+join+ on the title screen. Input the server IP address and press connect (raw IP address should be used, not the hostname). You are then taken to the lobby screen, once ready for the game to start press \verb+Ready+ in the bottom left corner. Once all of the players are ready the server automatically starts the game after a time delay.

\section*{In-game}

The game is controlled using the analog pads found in the lower corners of the screen. The left pad controls the position of the player, use it to move around the map. The right pad is used to control the direction and fire the weapon. Hold the pad down and move around to aim the player. Then once ready let go to shoot. The weapon has a reload delay between firing.

\section*{Game over}

Once all but one player has been killed, the game switches to the score screen displaying the winner. Restart the game to play again.
